# Team-102-5 - Introducing Project MyNews

The ultimate social news reading platform to keep everyone informed and together!


## Project Description
MyNews is a social news following platform that aggregates articles from a variety of news sources.
Today, many people in the world feel that they are not up to date on current trends and important world events. For those that do try to keep in touch, misinformation and source reliability is a huge pain point for news readers.
Our app pulls in news from all sources, includes political bias flags, and has social gamification features with friends to promote more active news reading.
